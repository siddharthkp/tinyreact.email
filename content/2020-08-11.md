It's a week of new releases.

### 1. [Rome - first beta release](https://romefrontend.dev/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html) by Sebastian McKenzie

> Even though this is a beta, we have support for over 100 lint rules, including the most common rules needed when working with TypeScript and React. This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and more, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.

### 2. [React v17.0 Release Candidate](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html) by Dan Abramov and Rachel Nabors

A look into the strategy and a few subtle breaking updates into the next version of React.

> We’re actively working on the new React features, but they’re not a part of this release. The React 17 release is a key part of our strategy to roll them out without leaving anyone behind.

### 3. [Library: Bumbag](https://bumbag.style) by Jake Moxey

An accessible & themeable React UI Kit enabling you to rapidly build web apps with 70+ components. Uses emotion and reakit under the hood.
