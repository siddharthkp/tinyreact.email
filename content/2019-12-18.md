### 2. [Talk: React (with Hooks) from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFO4m7Y-yhs) by Shawn Wang

> In this talk, we’ll create an effective mental model of React Hooks by building a tiny clone of React! This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!
