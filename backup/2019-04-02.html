          Using CSS conventions from Bootstrap for the API design of your React
          components can lead to bad decisions. Here's what you can learn from
          "The Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin in the context of React.

          One of the main considerations in creating this component was that I
          needed it to be reusable on multiple pages of the site, so my goal was
          to create something that could be imported and utilized in other react
          components in order to add to a div which had content that would need
          to be scrolled through.

          Load data asynchronously into your React components. Works on both
          client and server render.
