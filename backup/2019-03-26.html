          Phil Karlton (and many people after) said that one of the hardest
          problems in computer science is naming things. This is unfortunate for
          us because it means that building a design system is a hard problem
          before we even get to any of the underlying design and technology
          issues.

            >My Intuition on When to Use Custom React Hooks</a
          >

        <p>
          Custom hooks are like mixins: they’re a great way to share stateful
          and side-effectful functionality between components. Let’s investigate
          the catch by diving into an example, before building some intuition
          around when to use custom hooks — and when to use something else.

          >
          (library) by Swizec Teller
        </h3>
        <p>
          The other day I wanted to measure some DOM nodes. This is useful when
          you have to align items, or respond to browser width, or … lots of
          reasons okay. I had to align a curvy line with elements that aren’t
          under my control. This little stepper component uses flexbox to evenly
          space circles, CSS layouting aligns the title, and you see where this
          is going.
